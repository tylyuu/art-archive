<p>I am reacting to stories that ignite my imagination. My paintings depict my perspective of seeing the world as a big lie, with bizarre and motley images painting the distorted reality. I see lies that people made up in social activities being a story exchanging, and this exchange of stories drives my paintings. The process of viewing my paintings through my eyes is similar to the process of reading stories based on an author’s experiences, and I expect viewers to form projections with their own knowledge.</p>
<p>I rely on my intuition in the painting process. The randomness of marks and shapes occur more freely as I consider the elements more before painting. My color palette is shaped by the illusory tone of my imagined world. The ambiguity of objects in my paintings represents the difficulty in speaking the truth. The absurd ingredients and nonsensical rhetoric correspond with my use of chaotic marks to make viewers get lost in the complicated compositions. I use unintentional blank space and atelic figuration to make paintings vivid and respirable.</p>
<p>Reading guides the way I paint, for literature to be a unique thinking mode for human beings. I comprehend ideas that authors bury between lines and use imagery to represent their ideas, and take the opportunity to play with the content instead of retelling it. The marvel of stories became a creative language to present the world through my eyes under a filter, formed under my subjective consciousness. I want to share my insecurities around communicating with others, and the sudden respite from the straightforwardness of literary plots and faithfulness of characters in my art. I transfer the lack of honesty in human interactions into story exchanging as a method of self-consolation, and see the lies people tell due to unconscious self-defense as telling stories. Therefore stories are reflecting individual creators, and the characteristics of individuals result in the diversity and uniqueness of stories. As lies disclose the truth, I see individuals standing behind the stories and learn from them indirectly.</p>
